## 2. C Program that takes an array of integers and pass that array to a function to print array values after multiplying them to 10. 
	(try to use "Array Notation" and "Pointer notation")
	


## 3. C Program have a function changes the position of the first point of a given line struct "each line have 2 points", 
	then inside main displays the new coordinates along with line Length. (Pointer to struct)
   	function prototype should be like: 
		void change_Position(struct line *L, int newX, int newY)


## 4. C Program that asks the user for number of Lines he want "line is a struct, each line have 2 points", 
	then displays length of each one.(Dynamic Allocation of 1D Array of objects)
